This paper investigates the improbability of achieving an exceptional swim time of 46.40s in the men’s 100m freestyle using statistical modeling. The analysis applies Monte Carlo simulation, the Extreme Value Theorem (EVT), and the Gompertz distribution to assess and compare the likelihood of this rare event. The findings reveal that while Monte Carlo and EVT highlight the extremity of the time, the Gompertz distribution suggests a higher probability, emphasizing the influence of different modeling assumptions on rare event prediction. These results underscore the importance of selecting appropriate statistical tools to understand performance limits in competitive sports.

•	EVT (GEV Distribution) Probability: 0.000567

•	Gompertz Distribution Probability: 0.498757

•	Monte Carlo Simulation Probability: 0.0001

The Monte Carlo simulation yielded a low probability for the 46.40s time, reflecting the empirical rarity of such an outcome based on random sampling from the observed data distribution. Similarly, the EVT approach, through the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, modeled the probability of minimum values in the dataset and confirmed that this swim time lies on the extreme end, reinforcing its rarity. These two methods suggest that a time as fast as 46.40s is highly unlikely within the context of typical competitive performances.
However, the Gompertz distribution presented a different perspective, yielding a probability close to 50% for a swim time of 46.40s. This relatively high probability indicates that, within the fitted Gompertz model, a swim time of 46.40s does not lie as far outside the realm of expected performance as might be inferred from the other methods.
